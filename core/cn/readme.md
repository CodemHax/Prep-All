# Introduction to Computer Networks

A **computer network** is a system of interconnected computing devices that can communicate and share resources with each other. These resources may include files, printers, applications, and internet connections. Networking enables efficient communication, collaboration, and data sharing across small or large distances.

## Key Features of Computer Networks

1. **Resource Sharing**
   - Devices can share hardware (printers, storage) and software (applications, databases).
   
2. **Communication**
   - Users can exchange data and messages through email, chat, and video conferencing.
   
3. **Scalability**
   - Networks can expand by adding more devices without major structural changes.

4. **Reliability**
   - Backup systems and fault tolerance increase availability of services.

## Types of Computer Networks

1. **LAN (Local Area Network)**
   - Covers a small geographical area (e.g., office, home).
   - High speed, low cost.

2. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**
   - Spans a city or a large campus.
   - Useful for organizations with multiple branches.

3. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
   - Covers very large areas, even across countries.
   - The **Internet** is the best example.

## Basic Components of Networks

- **Hardware**
  - Routers, switches, hubs, cables, wireless access points.
- **Software**
  - Network operating systems, applications, and protocols.

## Network Protocols

Protocols are rules that govern communication between devices. The most important is **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)**, which powers the internet.

## Advantages of Computer Networks

- **Faster communication**  
- **Easy resource sharing**  
- **Centralized data management**  
- **Cost efficiency**  
- **Remote access to data and applications**
